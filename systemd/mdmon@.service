[Service]
# The mdmon starting in the initramfs (with dracut at least)
# cannot see sysfs after root is mounted, so we will have to
# 'takeover'.  As the '--offroot --takeover' don't hurt when
# not necessary, are useful with root-on-md in dracut,
# have them always present.
ExecStart=BINDIR/mdmon --foreground --offroot --takeover %I
# Don't set the PIDFile.  It isn't necessary (systemd can work
# it out) and systemd will remove it when transitioning from
# initramfs to rootfs.
#PIDFile=/run/mdadm/%I.pid
# The default slice is system-mdmon.slice which Conflicts
# with shutdown, causing mdmon to exit early.  So use system.slice.
