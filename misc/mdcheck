# This script should be run periodically to automatically
# perform a 'check' on any md arrays.
#
# It supports a 'time budget' such that any incomplete 'check'
# will be checkpointed when that time has expired.
# A subsequent invocation will allow the 'check' to continue.
#
# Arrays are identified by UUID and the 'sync_completed' value is stored
# in /var/lib/mdcheck/MD_UUID_$UUID. When the script has finished checking
# an array, it creates a file /var/lib/mdcheck/Checked_$UUID.
#
# Modes are:
#   --continue      Don't start new checks, only continue previously started
#                   ones for which MD_UUID_$UUID already exists.
#   --start         Like --continue, but also start new checks for arrays
#                   for which the file Checked_$UUID does not exist.
#   --restart:      Enable restarting checks that were previously finished
#                   (remove all Checked_* files) and exit immediately.
#                   This mode doesn't start any array checks.
#
# With none of these options given, a new check from 0 will be started on
# all arrays, even those that hadn't finished before.
#
# Options are:
#   --duration    This is passed to "date --date=$duration" to find out
#		  when to finish


# If the script is run from systemd, simply write to the journal on stderr.
# Otherwise, use logger.
